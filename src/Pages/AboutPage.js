            I am a proficient software developer with expertise in web
            development, specializing in both front-end and back-end
            technologies. On the front-end, I excel in utilizing HTML, CSS, and
            JavaScript, complemented by frameworks including Bootstrap, ReactJS,
            and VueJS. I am adept at incorporating libraries such as Google
            Material UI to enhance the user interface.
          </p>
          <p style={{ fontSize: "15px" }}>
            For back-end development, I leverage technologies such as NodeJs
            with the ExpressJs framework and PHP with the Laravel framework. For
            managing data effectively, Iâ€™m knowledgeable in MongoDB and MySQL.
            My comprehensive skill set enables me to create robust and efficient
            web applications that meet the highest standards of functionality
            and design.
          </p>
          <p style={{ fontSize: "15px" }}>
            Furthermore, I possess proficiency in Android development, utilizing
            Kotlin and Jetpack Compose to craft sophisticated and user-friendly
            Android applications. With a keen eye for detail and a commitment to
            staying abreast of the latest industry trends, I ensure the delivery
            of cutting-edge solutions that exceed client expectations.
          </p>
          <p style={{ fontSize: "15px" }}>
            In addition to software development, I have a strong foundation in
            cybersecurity. My expertise includes network security, ethical
            hacking, and securing applications and servers. I am experienced in
            vulnerability assessment, penetration testing, and implementing
            security measures to safeguard sensitive data and systems against
            threats. Combining my software development and cybersecurity
            knowledge, I create secure and resilient solutions tailored to meet
            diverse client needs.
          </p>
          <p style={{ fontSize: "15px" }}>
            I am also a skilled UI/UX designer, proficient in designing
            intuitive, user-friendly interfaces that enhance the overall user
            experience. My approach combines creativity with a deep
            understanding of user behavior, ensuring that the designs are not
            only visually appealing but also highly functional. By leveraging
            tools such as Figma and Adobe XD, I deliver designs that align with
            modern standards and resonate with target audiences.
